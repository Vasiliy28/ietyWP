“Variant Landing Page Theme" Documentation by InkThemes

This theme has been designed for those who want to have single landing page website. 

That's why you will see the landing page by default on the front page when you activated the theme.

This is the primary reason, we have not included the menu on the front and you are not seeing it when you are activating the theme.

However, there are some users who would just want to use the theme as normal blog based theme and need to display core WordPress blog posts on their website.

To allow doing that, Theme has come with a blog template, which can be assigned to any page.

That page can then be setup as "To show on the front page" from the Reading settings.

The navigation menu will appears, when you select blog template as front page or visit other pages.
 
Once the user creates a new page with Blog template and shows it on front, the same theme will act like any other default WordPress blog theme.
